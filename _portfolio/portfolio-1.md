![Fire Weather App](/images/cd_fwi_app.png)

Fire Weather Web App available at [climatedata.ca/fire-weather](https://climatedata.ca/fire-weather/).

This web applicaiton allows users to explore, visualize, and download gridded and station based fire weather projections data for Canada. This Python app is built using the Panels package. I was a primary contributor to developing this web application while working at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in the Canadian Centre for Climate Services (CCCS) as a student researcher.
