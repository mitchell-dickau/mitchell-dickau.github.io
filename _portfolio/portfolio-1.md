![Fire Weather App](/images/cd_fwi_app.png)

Fire Weather Web App available at [climatedata.ca/fire-weather](https://climatedata.ca/fire-weather/).

This web applicaiton allows users to explore, visualize, and download gridded and station based fire weather projections data for Canada. This Python app is built using the Panels package. I was a primary contributor to developing this webb application while working at Environment and Climate Change Canada.
