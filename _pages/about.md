I am a climate scientist in the last year of my PhD in the Geography, Urban, and Environmental studies program at Concordia University in Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada. In my research, I use climate models to investigate questions related to the climate outcomes of overshoot and remaining carbon budgets.
